# End to End Use Case

The Data Cube Access Building Block elaborates an end-to-end use case that shows how EOEPCA Building Blocks are used together to solve a real world problem covering the following steps:

- Get external data sets
- Apply STAC Best Practices
- Save metadata
- Register updated metadata to the STAC API
- Access and Process the registered data sets
- Register the results to the STAC API
